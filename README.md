# Highlight Search Terms
Very lightweight jQuery script that wraps search terms in an HTML5 mark tag when referer is a search engine or within wp search results.

Highlights search terms using jQuery when referer is a search engine _or_ within WordPress generated search results. This plugin is a light weight, low resource demanding and very simple fusion between <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/04/10/how-to-highlight-search-terms-with-jquery/">How to Highlight Search Terms with jQuery - theme hack by Thaya Kareeson</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-highlight/">Search Hilite by Ryan Boren</a>, with some optimisations and updated to support HTML5.

**Features**

- BuddyPress / bbPress compatibility: highlighting within forum searches
- Caching (WP Super Cache) compatibility
- Click through highlights: Highlights not only on WP search results page but also one click deeper inside any of the found pages
- Search terms wrapped in double qoutes now considered as single term
- Support for many more search engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo, Lycos, Ask, AOL, Baidu, Youdao, Dogpile, Search.com, Goodsearch.com, Mywebsearch.com, Webcrawler.com, Info.com

**NOTE:** to make the highlights visible in browsers that do not support HTML5 like Internet Explorer 8 or older you will have to define at least one CSS hilite styling!
